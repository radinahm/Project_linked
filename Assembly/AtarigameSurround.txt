The object of the game is to keep the moving asterisks (*) from crossing its own path or colliding with the
boundary of the board. The internal size of the board is 20 spaces horizontally and 10 vertically. When
the game starts, the * starts to move. The initial position of the * is random. The initial direction of the
movement is also random. The * moves at a rate of once every Â½ second. The user can change the
direction of the movement by pressing w for up, s for down, a for left, and d for right. As the * moves, it
should leave a path of * in its wake. The game ends when the * crosses its path or collides with the
boundary. Every time a new * is displayed on the screen, the score should increase by one. When the
game starts, directions should be displayed, and the user should be instructed to press a key to start. You
may choose the key they press to start, but let the user know what that key is in the instructions. After
that key is pressed, the * starts moving and the game is underway.
